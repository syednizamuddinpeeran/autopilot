factory agent (orchestrator)
  1. skill issue-intake     → .agent-work/issue-N/brief.md
  2. planner subagent       → plan.md        (writes only the plan)
  3. implementer subagent   → one commit per plan task, test-first (looped over T1…Tn)
  4. skill verify-changes   → scripts/factory/check.sh → verify.log (≤3 fix loops)
  5. reviewer subagent      → review.md      (BLOCKING / NIT, VERDICT) (≤2 fix loops)
  6. skill open-pr          → PR "Closes #N" (draft if high risk / failed / open questions)

CI (verify, hooks-selftest, guardrails-unchanged) + branch protection
      ▼
human: reviews and merges the PR
```

Hooks wrap every step (see [security-model.md](security-model.md)) and write an audit trail to `.agent-logs/`.

## Key design ideas

- **Small orchestrator context.** The factory passes file paths between steps, not content. Heavy work runs in subagents.
- **Files are the interface.** Each step reads and writes files in `.agent-work/issue-N/`, so any step can be inspected or resumed.
- **One verification gate.** `check.sh` is the single definition of "good"; agents, humans and CI all use it.
- **Humans own the rules.** Hooks, workflows, policy and the check scripts cannot be edited by the agent (guard hook), and CI fails agent PRs that touch them.
- **Merge is human-only.** Branch protection requires a human approval and the required checks; the agent never merges.

| `scripts/factory/` | `commands.env`, `check.sh`, `setup.sh`, `run-issue.sh`, `test-hooks.sh` | yes |
| `.agent-work/issue-N/` | issue.json, brief, plan, verify.log, review, decisions, pr-body | no (gitignored) |
| `.agent-logs/` | `<session>.jsonl`, `index.jsonl`, `.verified` marker | no (gitignored) |
| `../<repo>-worktrees/issue-N/` | Isolated checkout per local run | outside repo |

## Isolation model

- **Cloud:** the agent runs in an ephemeral GitHub Actions–based environment prepared by `copilot-setup-steps.yml`. Hook logs there are discarded with the environment.
- **Local:** each issue gets its own git worktree on its own `agent/issue-N-*` branch; your main checkout is never touched. `.agent-work/` and `.agent-logs/` are per-worktree.

## The verification marker

`check.sh` computes a hash of the working state (HEAD + tracked diff + untracked file hashes) and stores it in `.agent-logs/.verified` only if every configured check passes. The `agentStop` hook recomputes the hash; any edit after the last green run changes the hash and the agent is forced to re-verify before it can finish.
